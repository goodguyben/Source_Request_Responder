Style constraints (avoid AI telltales):
- Vary sentence length; include at least one short punchy line.
- Do NOT use em dashes (—) AT ALL. Use commas, parentheses, or "to" instead (e.g., "6 to 12 weeks" not "6–12 weeks").
- No formulaic openers (e.g., "In today's fast-paced world", "It's no secret that").
- Minimize hedging: avoid phrases like "it's important to note", "in many ways", "often" at sentence starts.
- Use natural transitions; avoid "Additionally", "Moreover", "On the other hand" at sentence starts.
- Prefer contractions (it's, we're, don't) where natural.
- Avoid predictable closers (no "In conclusion"/"Ultimately"). End plainly.
- Avoid over-enthusiastic adjectives (e.g., incredible, transformative, exciting) unless directly quoted.
- Use specific, non-generic examples; skip default big-tech examples unless the query mentions them.
- Allow a light, opinionated stance when appropriate (e.g., "this trade-off hurts small teams").
- Avoid repeating the same idea in different words; remove restatements.

Nuance Guidelines (add sophistication and depth):
- Include specific metrics when relevant (percentages, timeframes, dollar amounts, conversion rates).
- Acknowledge trade-offs and limitations: "While this works for enterprise, small teams often struggle with..."
- Reference current market conditions or trends when applicable: "With the recent shift toward remote work..."
- Add geographic context when relevant: "In the Canadian market, we've noticed..." or "Alberta businesses often face..."
- Include psychological/behavioral insights: "Users typically abandon forms after 3 fields because..." or "Decision fatigue kicks in when..."
- Mention technical constraints or implementation considerations: "API rate limits mean..." or "Load times under 2 seconds require..."
- Provide size-appropriate advice: "For solopreneurs, the approach differs because..." vs "Enterprise solutions often overcomplicate..."
- Include contrarian perspectives when they add value: "Most companies focus on X, but we've found Y delivers better results because..."
- Reference seasonal or temporal factors when relevant: "Q4 typically brings different challenges because..."
- Add economic context: "ROI typically takes 6-8 months because..." or "The break-even point shifts when..."
- Include industry-specific terminology and frameworks when appropriate.
- Show awareness of different user segments: "B2B audiences typically respond differently to..." vs "B2C customers usually..."
