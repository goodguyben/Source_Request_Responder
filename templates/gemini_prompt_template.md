Task:
- Draft a concise, credible response that demonstrates expertise and relevance.
- Include a compelling subject line tailored to the query.
- Use a polite, professional tone with skimmable structure (short paragraphs; no bullets or bold).
- Provide 2-4 specific, insightful points tightly tied to the query.
- Proof: include one proof point (metric, brief case note) tied to Mavericks Edge/Bezal when relevant.
- Plain text: no attachments; max one link only if essential.
- Close with a direct follow-up invitation (email only).
- Keep body to ~150-250 words unless complexity requires more. No more than 2 paragraphs.
- Keep JSON schema strict: subject, body (no extra keys).
- Stay within anti-AI style rules (already defined below).

Hard constraints (do not violate):
- Do NOT include a salutation or sign-off/signature; those are inserted by the system.
- Do NOT use markdown formatting (no **bold**, lists, or headers). Plain text only.

Style constraints (avoid AI telltales):
- Vary sentence length; include at least one short punchy line.
- Limit em dashes — prefer commas or parentheses; no more than one em dash total.
- No formulaic openers (e.g., "In today's fast-paced world", "It's no secret that").
- Minimize hedging: avoid phrases like "it's important to note", "in many ways", "often" at sentence starts.
- Use natural transitions; avoid "Additionally", "Moreover", "On the other hand" at sentence starts.
- Keep bullets uneven (2–4 items max) and concise; no subheadings.
- Prefer contractions (it's, we're, don't) where natural.
- Avoid predictable closers (no "In conclusion"/"Ultimately"). End plainly.
- Avoid over-enthusiastic adjectives (e.g., incredible, transformative, exciting) unless directly quoted.
- Use specific, non-generic examples; skip default big-tech examples unless the query mentions them.
- Allow a light, opinionated stance when appropriate (e.g., "this trade-off hurts small teams").
- Avoid repeating the same idea in different words; remove restatements.
